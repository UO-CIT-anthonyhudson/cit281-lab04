## CIT 281 Lab 04

In this lab we:
- Create initial Fastify Node.js web server
- Initialize as a Node.js project folder using Node Package Manager (npm)
- Add Fastify to project using npm, and test using Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Add git repo, exclude node_modules folder from git, make commits
- Fix MIME error, test, and commit
- Add a second route with query parameters, test, and commit

I learned how to work with the Fastify node server and how to make it work with Javascript.
